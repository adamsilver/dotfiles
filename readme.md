### dotfiles.

Actually, mostly just shell scripts. OSX-only for now, but I'll make it OS independent when I actually get the need to do so.

### Installation

Run this inconspicous `curl` pipe to `sh`:

```bash
$ curl setup.vararu.me | sh
```

Or clone the repo and run the install script manually.
